# Project Context

## Current Status

**Phase**: Initial Setup Complete
**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Sprint**: Setup & Architecture

### Completed Items
- [x] Project directory structure created
- [x] Core documentation files established
- [x] Basic React Native project scaffold
- [x] Git repository initialized

### In Progress
- [ ] Component architecture implementation
- [ ] API service layer setup
- [ ] State management configuration
- [ ] Navigation structure

### Blocked Items
- None currently

## Design Decisions

### Technical Architecture
- **Framework**: React Native 0.72+
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 6
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
- **UI Components**: React Native Elements + custom components
- **Image Handling**: React Native Fast Image for performance
- **API**: RESTful service (TBD - Unsplash, Pixabay, or custom)

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Modular Structure**: Separate concerns with dedicated folders for components, screens, services
2. **Performance Focus**: Implement lazy loading and image optimization from the start
3. **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase with platform-specific optimizations where needed
4. **Offline Support**: Cache management for previously viewed images

## Iteration Notes

### Session 1 (2025-01-19)
**Focus**: Project Setup & Documentation
- Created comprehensive project structure
- Established documentation templates for PM workflow
- Defined technical requirements and constraints
- Set up git repository with proper ignore patterns

**Decisions Made**:
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Implement tab-based navigation for main sections
- Focus on image search and gallery as core features
- Plan for offline functionality from the beginning

**Next Priority**: Component implementation and API integration

## Stakeholder Input

### Product Requirements
- Mobile-first experience with intuitive navigation
- Fast image loading and smooth scrolling
- Search functionality with real-time results
- Gallery view with full-screen image viewing

### Technical Constraints
- Must support iOS 12+ and Android API 21+
- Performance targets: <3s launch time, 60fps scrolling
- Memory optimization for image handling critical
- Offline capability for cached content

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- API rate limiting and costs for image services
- Image loading performance on slower devices
- Memory management for large image datasets

### Medium Risk
- Platform-specific UI differences
- App store approval process
- Network connectivity handling

### Low Risk
- React Native framework stability
- Third-party library compatibility
- Basic navigation implementation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Set up package.json with all required dependencies
2. Implement App.js/tsx with basic navigation
3. Create core component structure (SearchScreen, GalleryScreen)
4. Set up API service layer foundation

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement search functionality with debounced input
2. Create gallery grid layout with lazy loading
3. Add image viewer with zoom capabilities
4. Integrate with external image API

### Medium Term (3-4 weeks)
1. Add offline caching functionality
2. Implement advanced search filters
3. Optimize performance and memory usage
4. Add error handling and loading states
