# Project Context

## Current Status

**Phase**: Three-Layer UI Architecture Development
**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Sprint**: UI Components & Gesture System

### Completed Items
- [x] Project directory structure created
- [x] Core documentation files established
- [x] Basic React Native project scaffold
- [x] Git repository initialized
- [x] Apple Photos-inspired gallery prototype (MTBGalleryExpoSnack.js)
- [x] Component separation for testing (HeroHeaderTest, SearchBarTest, BottomToolbarTest, ImageGridTest)
- [x] Three-layer UI architecture design and requirements documentation
- [x] Gesture-based interaction patterns implementation
- [x] Expo Snack compatibility for rapid prototyping

### In Progress
- [ ] SearchPageTest.js with three-layer architecture
- [ ] Remaining page implementations (Gallery, People/Social, Collections)

### Blocked Items
- None currently

## Design Decisions

### Technical Architecture
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo compatibility
- **Animation**: React Native Reanimated 3 for 60fps performance
- **Gestures**: React Native Gesture Handler for Apple Photos-style interactions
- **Image Handling**: Picsum Photos API for reliable Expo Snack testing
- **UI Pattern**: Three-layer architecture (pull down/default/pull up)
- **State Management**: Local state with useSharedValue for animations
- **API**: AI-powered search integration (future)

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Three-Layer UI Pattern**: Apple Photos-inspired gesture system with contextual layers
2. **Component Separation**: Individual test files for each component for easier debugging
3. **Expo Snack Compatibility**: All components designed to work in browser-based testing
4. **Gesture-First Design**: Pull gestures as primary navigation method
5. **Performance Focus**: 60fps animations with native driver usage
6. **Inverted Lists**: Newest content at bottom for natural photo browsing

## Iteration Notes

### Session 1 (2025-01-19)
**Focus**: Three-Layer UI Architecture Implementation
- Created Apple Photos-inspired gallery with gesture-based interactions
- Built modular component architecture with separate test files
- Implemented comprehensive three-layer UI system documentation
- Established Expo Snack compatibility for rapid prototyping

**Decisions Made**:
- Three-layer UI pattern as core interaction model
- Component separation for easier testing and debugging
- Gesture-first navigation over traditional tab navigation
- Picsum Photos API for reliable image loading in Expo environment
- Removed spring animations in favor of timing-based transitions

**Key Components Built**:
- MTBGalleryExpoSnack.js: Full integrated gallery implementation
- HeroHeaderTest.js: Header state transitions testing
- SearchBarTest.js: Pull-up search gesture implementation
- BottomToolbarTest.js: Pill-shaped toolbar with blur effects
- ImageGridTest.js: Configurable grid with layout options

**Next Priority**: Individual page implementations with three-layer architecture

## Stakeholder Input

### Product Requirements
- Apple Photos-inspired three-layer UI with gesture-based navigation
- AI-powered natural language search capabilities
- Social collaboration and people management features
- Smart collections and auto-curation functionality
- 60fps animations and smooth scroll performance

### Technical Constraints
- Expo Snack compatibility for rapid prototyping
- iOS 12+ and Android API 21+ support required
- Performance targets: <3s launch time, 60fps scrolling, <1.5s search response
- Three-layer UI requires complex gesture handling and state management
- AI search requires reliable network connectivity

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Complex gesture system implementation and performance
- AI search service integration and costs
- Three-layer UI state management complexity
- Memory management for large photo libraries with gesture animations

### Medium Risk
- Expo Snack limitations for advanced gesture testing
- Platform-specific gesture behavior differences
- Social collaboration feature complexity
- Image loading performance with gesture animations

### Low Risk
- React Native Reanimated 3 stability and performance
- Picsum Photos API reliability for prototyping
- Component separation and modular architecture

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. Build SearchPageTest.js with three-layer architecture implementation
2. Create remaining page test implementations (GalleryPageTest, PeoplePageTest, CollectionsPageTest)
3. Test gesture interactions and performance across all pages
4. Validate Expo Snack compatibility for all components

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Integrate AI-powered search functionality with natural language processing
2. Implement social collaboration features and activity feeds
3. Add smart collections and auto-curation capabilities
4. Build face detection and people management features

### Medium Term (3-4 weeks)
1. Optimize gesture performance and memory usage across all pages
2. Add offline functionality for cached content and core browsing
3. Implement cross-page navigation and state persistence
4. Integrate with external services (cloud storage, AI APIs)
